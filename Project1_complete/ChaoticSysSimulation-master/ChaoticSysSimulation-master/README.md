## Notes:

#### The tutorial includes both Jupyter Notebook (ipynb files) and Matlab Live Script (mlx files)

- Notebooks:
    - chaotic_system_simulation.ipynb
    - chaotic_system_simulation.html
- Live Scripts:
    - ForecastingChaos.mlx
    - NeuralNetworksChaos.mlx
    - MultiplePendulum.mlx

#### The Jupyter Notebook includes animated plots as videos which may not work correctly on the github page. Please use the html file in the repo (chaotic_system_simulation.html), or run the notebook locally to see the animations.

- If any of the above does not work on your machine please let us know. We will be glad to demo them for grading purpose. Thank you!
