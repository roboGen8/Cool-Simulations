Important files in this folder:
main.py --> contains code that matches the event-oriented world view
engine.py --> contains the classes including Event, FutureEventList, Vehicle, World
            also contains the EventHandler function
constants.py --> contains signal timing data and max sizes of the queues

Other files:
data.py, data_helper, data_vars, data_classes
    --> used for NGSIM data analysis
Given files:
signalTiming.xls --> stoplight signals of 10th to 14th intersection of Peachtree St NE
trajectories-0400pm-0415pm_editted.csv --> 15 minute vehicle data

How to run program: python main.py
Sample output (small part of actual output), This output can easily be changed
by looking from line 100 of main.py. "Now" represents time from 0 to 900 seconds
and below it is the road network with number of vehicles in each queue
Now: 862
